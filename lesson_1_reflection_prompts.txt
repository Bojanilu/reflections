How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?


    It showed the lines that were added or changed.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
 efficient programmer in the long term?


    It would be easier to control and organize.    


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
 commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?


   Pro: I decide when to commit
   Con: Possibility to forget to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


    Because they are related to each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?


    With git log (--stat) I can see all the commints I've made.
    And now with [git diff file1 file 2] I can compare the changes of two versions of files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?


    Because i can shift from one version to another easily.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?


    Web Development, Software Development
